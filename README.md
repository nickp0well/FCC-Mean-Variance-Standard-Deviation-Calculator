# FCC-Mean-Variance-Standard-Deviation-Calculator
This repository, as a part of freeCodeCamp's Data Analysis with Python course contains a function, calculate() which uses the NumPy library to output the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum of the rows, columns, and elements in a 3 x 3 matrix. The input of the function should be a list containing 9 digits. The function converts the list into a 3 x 3 NumPy array, and then returns a dictionary containing the mean, variance, standard deviation, max, min, and sum along both axes and for the flattened matrix. If a list containing less than 9 elements is passed into the function, it raises a ValueError exception with the message: "List must contain nine numbers."
